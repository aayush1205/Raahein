# RAAHEIN: From en-route to EndRoute


<h3> In Case You Need Motivation: </h3>

Guys! 

Look where we are. In 34 in the entire nation. The place where we are going to is not your usual competition. Just imagine, you are a "developer" now. Isn't that exciting enough? All those bug fixes, all those all-nighter, all the pain will be worth it I promise. Resillience...Ressilience is the key.  Keep at it. It will all be worth it with that check in your hand.

Keep at it. I trust you guys! Heptad is the fucking best!

<h3>The real shit: Github CLI </h3>

<p>
  
  Okay. Now, how are we going to work. 
  
  Clone the repository to your system.
  
  *Make your own seperate branch. No changes to the master without the permission of us all. I mean it.*
  
  If your application/work is in some other directory, copy paste it to the repo you cloned, then git add, git commit, and
  git push origin <your fucking branch, not master>
  
</p>
